          I have previously worked in a research laboratory at the University of Maryland Institute for Advanced Computer Studies studying artificial intelligence and metacognitive systems under the mentorship of Dr. Donald Perlis. This was after
          taking a class in AI at UMD over the summer.

          I have some experience with contest math and physics, as well as CTF-style challenges. Recently, I've gotten into <a href="https://m3challenge.siam.org/sites/default/files/uploads/TC%20WINNER_13662.pdf" target="_blank"

          I have some systems experience from the few years I helped manage the servers for my school. I've also made some websites and web apps, primarily in Django or Jekyll. In terms of languages, Python is my favorite, but I've had good
          experiences
          scripting in R and Wolfram Language.
