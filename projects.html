            <h2>Graduation Tickets</h2>
            <p>Our school recently moved its graduation ceremony from a small venue to a large venue. Now that families are given more tickets than they need, the parent listservs blow up every year with parents asking other families for tickets. This is a mess, so I made a website that would match up people with spare tickets with people who need them, so random people don't have to hear about it.</p>

            <h2>Voting</h2>
            <p>My congregation holds frequent elections for board and committee positions. Recently some of them have had messy results and aftermaths. I was also unhappy with the way ballots were cast, which allowed people to vote more than once, make others' votes not count, and it was even possible to trace who voted for whom. I took the elections online, making it secure so that only members could vote, people could vote only once, and the votes are anonymous. I also wrote an algorithm to count the votes using a Single Transferable Vote system (Droop method).</p>

            <h2>Inverter/ CHANGE TO BBOPS</h2>
            <p>My grandparents recently moved to the coast of North Carolina (9 miles from the South Carolina border), and in their short time there have been subjected to multiple hurricanes and floods. Needless to say, their power got knocked out quite often. My grandfather, who used to teach Electrical Engineering, wanted to build a pure sine wave inverter to power things like his refrigerator. This became a joint project over the last two years, with him finding most of the parts, and me handling most of the programming.</p>
