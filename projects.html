            <p>This past summer, I worked in a University of Maryland research laboratory studying artificial intelligence and metacognitive systems under the mentorship of Dr. Donald Perlis. <a target="_blank" href="https://mclumd.github.io/ALMECOM%20Papers/2019/Perlis%20et%20al.%20-%202019%20-%20Live%20and%20Learn%2C%20Ask%20and%20Tell%20Agents%20Over%20Tasks.pdf">This proposal paper</a> outlines the plans for the project.</p>

            <h2>Peter and the Wolf</h2>
            <p>After two years sponsoring a community music festival based on Camille Saint-Saëns’s <i>Carnival of the Animals</i>, our high school is shifting to a new performance: Sergei Prokofiev’s <i>Peter and the Wolf</i>. I created the website for this new, upcoming event.</p>

            <h2>Carnival of the Animals</h2>
            <p>I designed the materials for the launch of my high school’s first community music festival, which was created to inspire a love of music in younger children. I also maintain the event's webiste.</p>

            <h2>Graduation Tickets</h2>
            <p>Every June, parents of high school seniors post frantic notes to the school’s PTA listserv requesting additional graduation tickets. I built a service that matches families with extra tickets with people who need them to both ease the process of connecting people, and to spare everyone else a deluge of emails.</p>

            <h2>Voting</h2>
            <p>My congregation holds frequent elections for board and committee positions. Some elections had controversial results due to a paper ballot system which allowed people to vote more than once, and made it possible to trace voter identity. I advised the nominations committee of how to hold secure, online elections. I also advised them about the advantages of a Single Transferable Vote system (Droop method).</p>

            <h2>Inverter</h2>
            <p>Shortly after my grandparents moved to North Carolina, they were subjected to multiple hurricanes, which resulted not only in flooding but also power outages. My grandfather, who used to teach vocational electronics, wanted to build a pure sine wave inverter to power appliances like his refrigerator. This became a joint project over the last two years. He found most of the parts, and I handled most of the programming.</p>
